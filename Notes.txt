Profiling with a 30 LED dim rainbow runner and PulseColor.
Avg frame time is around 280ms.

Removed floats from KeyFrameColorInterpolator.
Avg frame time is now around 255ms.

Changed virtual SetColor function to passed CopyColor function...
Frame time is similar, around 250ms.  This one isn't worth it.  It makes
the code really ugly, and it doesn't save much time.

----------------
Six player rainbow spiral.
Avg time 125ms.
Removing dim mult and making original rainbow dim.
Avg time 60ms!!!  Holy crap.

Making keyframe interpolators array lookups.
Animation time is 37ms.
Total frame time is 50ms.  I think that's the fastest it can go.
Cool.

-----------------
Weird problems uploading now that I've added Fire.
42,134 bytes uploads fine.  No fire.
42,562 works.  Fire code commented out.
42,776 bytes works fine.  Uncommented constructor.
42,890 bytes works.  Uncommented start of fire Step loop.
43,108 bytes works.  Uncommented first for inner for loop.
43,554 bytes works now.  Everything's uncommented.  WTF.

------------------
More animation ideas:
Cube
Pong
Color sweeping across the table, side to side.

Fix the fire colors, so there's more variety farther out.
