Pong3

LED controller for Pong3 table.

This is the source code used to program an Arduino Mega, to control
the LED strips on the Pong3 table.  The table is 6 sided, with LEDs along
each border and from each corner to the center.  In addition, there are
2 strips of overhead LEDS.  The LEDs on the table are full RGB, individually
addressable.  The overhead strips are RGB but are not individually addressable,
so they must all be the same color.

A lot of compromises needed to made so the program would fit in memory, even
on the Arduino Mega.  While it has lots of Flash memory, so the code itself
can be fairly large, it has very limited RAM.  Some data, such as the graph
that indicates which LEDs neighbor which, is stored in Flash memory and copied
out as needed.

There are a lot of experiments in this code, and it's evolved clumsily
over time.  There's plenty of room to consolidate pieces and clean things up.
